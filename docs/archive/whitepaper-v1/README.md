# DAT Whitepaper: Decentralized Autonomous Treasury

## Transforming Token Competition into Cooperation

Welcome to the DAT (Decentralized Autonomous Treasury) documentation. This whitepaper explains how DAT creates economic alignment between tokens, turning what would be competitors into economic allies through automatic fee capture and buyback mechanisms.

## Quick Overview

### What is DAT?

DAT is a protocol that creates economic relationships between tokens. Every trade on connected tokens generates fees that are automatically:

1. **Captured** by smart contracts
2. **Split** between the token and its parent ecosystem
3. **Used for buybacks** to create deflationary pressure
4. **Burned** permanently reducing supply

### The Core Innovation

```
Without DAT:  Token A vs Token B vs Token C  (competition)
With DAT:     Token A + Token B + Token C → All benefit (cooperation)
```

### Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fee Source | Pump.fun creator fee (0.05% - 0.95% based on market cap) |
| Secondary Token Share | 55.2% (own buyback) |
| Root Token Share | 44.8% (ecosystem treasury) |
| Burn Rate | 100% of buybacks |

## The ASDF Ecosystem

**$ASDF** is the first root token implementing DAT. The ecosystem includes:

- **Root Token:** $ASDF (captures 44.8% from all secondaries)
- **Secondary Tokens:** Multiple tokens, each getting 55.2% of their own fees

```

         55.2% Burns           44.8% to Root
         (per token)           (all combined)
```

### For Token Holders
Understand why holding DAT-connected tokens gives you exposure to continuous deflationary pressure across an entire ecosystem, not just a single project.

### For Creators
Learn how launching as a secondary token gives you automatic buyback support and association with an established ecosystem.

### For Communities
Discover how DAT transforms fragmented communities into united ecosystems with aligned incentives.

### For Developers
Find technical resources to build on top of DAT: dashboards, analytics, integrations.

## The Vision

> "Pump.fun democratized token creation. DAT democratizes token cooperation."

DAT creates a world where:
- Every IP has a unified token ecosystem
- Creators capture value from their entire influence
- Communities grow together instead of apart
- Success is shared, not hoarded
- Copying is contribution, not theft
- Trust is replaced by code
