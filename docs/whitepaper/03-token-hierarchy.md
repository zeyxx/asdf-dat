# Token Hierarchy: Root and Secondary Tokens

## The Two-Tier System

DAT organizes tokens into a clear hierarchy that creates economic alignment while preserving independence.

```
                    ┌──────────────────┐
                    │   ROOT TOKEN     │
                    │   (The Original) │
                    └────────┬─────────┘
                             │
            ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
            │                │                │
            ▼                ▼                ▼
    ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
    │  Secondary   │ │  Secondary   │ │  Secondary   │
    │   Token A    │ │   Token B    │ │   Token C    │
    └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
```

## Root Token: The Foundation

The **Root Token** is the central token of an ecosystem. It's typically:
- The original project token
- The main brand or IP
- The creator's primary token
- The ecosystem treasury

### Root Token Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fee Collection** | Receives 44.8% of all secondary token fees |
| **Continuous Buybacks** | Automatic buyback & burn from accumulated treasury |
| **Ecosystem Growth** | Every new secondary strengthens the root |
| **Brand Protection** | Derivatives become allies, not threats |

### Root Token Responsibilities

- Defines the ecosystem identity
- Sets the standard for secondary tokens
- Benefits from (and is accountable to) the entire ecosystem

## Secondary Tokens: The Network

**Secondary Tokens** are any tokens linked to a root. They can be:
- Fan tokens
- Derivative projects
- Regional/language versions
- Collaborative ventures
- Meme variations
- Community initiatives

### Secondary Token Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dedicated Buybacks** | 55.2% of their own fees go to their buyback |
| **Proportional Support** | More activity = more buyback support |
| **Ecosystem Access** | Part of a larger, thriving community |
| **Legitimacy Signal** | Association with established root |

### Secondary Token Independence

Importantly, secondary tokens remain **independent projects**:
- Own community
- Own branding
- Own price action
- Own trading volume

The only link is the economic flow of creator fees.

## The Relationship Dynamic

### Traditional Model: Parent-Child Competition
```
Original Token ←── COMPETES WITH ──→ Derivative Token
     ↓                                      ↓
  Loses users                         Steals users
  Loses volume                        Dilutes brand
  Loses value                         Temporary pump
```

### DAT Model: Symbiotic Partnership
```
Root Token ←───── BENEFITS FROM ─────→ Secondary Token
     ↓                                       ↓
  Receives fees                        Gets buybacks
  Burns tokens                         Burns tokens
  Gains value                          Gains value
  Grows ecosystem                      Grows ecosystem
```

## Practical Example

Let's say **$TROLL** is an established meme token. Without DAT:

- $TROLL2, $BABYTROLL, $TROLLKING launch
- Each steals volume from $TROLL
- Community fragments across 4 tokens
- Everyone loses

With DAT:

- $TROLL becomes the **Root Token**
- $TROLL2, $BABYTROLL, $TROLLKING become **Secondaries**
- Every trade on ANY of them:
  - 55.2% → Burns that token
  - 44.8% → Burns $TROLL
- All four tokens become deflationary
- $TROLL holders benefit from entire ecosystem
- Secondary holders get dedicated support
- **Everyone wins**

## Unlimited Scalability

There's no limit to how many secondaries a root can have:

```
                         ROOT TOKEN
                              │
     ┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──┴──┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
     │      │      │      │     │      │      │      │
    SEC    SEC    SEC    SEC   SEC    SEC    SEC    SEC
     1      2      3      4     5      6      7      8
                              ...
                         (unlimited)
```

More secondaries = More fee sources = More burns = Stronger ecosystem

## Key Principles

### 1. Independence with Alignment
Secondary tokens are independent projects with aligned economic incentives.

### 2. Proportional Fairness
Each secondary gets buybacks proportional to its contribution.

### 3. Mutual Benefit
Root benefits from secondaries. Secondaries benefit from association with root.

### 4. No Permission Needed
Anyone can launch a secondary (though root can configure requirements).

### 5. Transparent Flows
All fee flows are on-chain and verifiable.
