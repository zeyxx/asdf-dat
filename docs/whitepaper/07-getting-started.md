# Getting Started: How to Participate in the DAT Ecosystem

## Ways to Participate

There are several ways to be part of the DAT ecosystem, depending on your role and goals.

---

## For Token Holders

### Hold Root Token ($ASDF)
The simplest way to participate. By holding the root token, you benefit from:
- Buybacks funded by ALL secondary token activity
- Continuous deflationary pressure
- Ecosystem growth

**What you do:** Buy and hold $ASDF
**What happens:** Your tokens become scarcer as the ecosystem grows

### Hold Secondary Tokens
Each secondary token has its own dedicated buyback from its trading activity.
- 55.2% of fees go to that specific token's buyback
- Benefit from that token's community and volume

**What you do:** Buy and hold any secondary token
**What happens:** That token burns based on its own activity

### Trade Within the Ecosystem
Every trade generates fees that power the system.
- Buy tokens you believe in
- Sell tokens when you want
- Know that every trade strengthens the ecosystem

**What you do:** Trade normally
**What happens:** Creator fees are captured for buybacks

2. Register derivatives as secondaries
3. Transform competition into cooperation
